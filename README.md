Small scale simulation of opening a Pokémon card pack

## Disclaimer: This project is a fan-made simulation for educational purposes. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with The Pokémon Company, Nintendo, or any official Pokémon entity. All trademarks and card data remain the property of their respective owners.

Based on their popular Pokémon TCGP app, this code simulates their denoted card probabilities for pack opening. In this project, I specifically have simulated one series rather than all the card options.
